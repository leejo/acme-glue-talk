# Glue

(Hit P for the notes)

???

Glue is the working title of a photo project I've been shooting since 2015

# I Need Your Help

???

And I need your help

---
class: center, middle, theBlackBackground

.image-100[![](img/01.jpg)]

???

I started it at The Swiss Perl Workshop

I've always been fond of this photo, it's one of the first I took

I've got in the region of 800 photos now

I've still got a couple of years left to go, I think, but I've started thinking about the final form

---
class: center, middle, theBlackBackground

```perl6
@photos.pick( 50 );
```

???

The way we usually do this is to pick a selection of photos to form a long edit

Then filter that down to a smaller selection

---
class: center, middle, theBlackBackground

.image-100[![](img/02.jpg)]

???

Another one from 2015

---
class: center, middle, theBlackBackground

```perl6
Seq
```

???

Then we figure out some sort of sequence, a starting point, a journey, and end point

---
class: center, middle, theBlackBackground

.image-100[![](img/03.jpg)]

???

Granada in 2015 also

---
class: center, middle, theBlackBackground

```perl6
Pair
```

???

Often as part of a sequence we pair images

Those which complement each other

Or those which contrast with each other

---
class: center, middle, theBlackBackground

.image-100[![](img/04.jpg)]

???

For example this image from Orlando sort of fits with the next image

---
class: center, middle, theBlackBackground

.image-100[![](img/04.jpg)]

.image-100[![](img/05.jpg)]

???

Can anyone think why?

Geometry. Lots of people, one person. Looking up, looking down

---
class: center, middle, theBlackBackground

.image-100[![](img/05.jpg)]

???

But I started to think about text, and how can I pair text with the images

---
class: theBlackBackground

<br />
<br />

```perl
my @ordered = @{ $required_order // [] }
	? map { [ @$_{ @{ $required_order } } ] } @{ $chaos }
	: map { [ @$_{sort keys %$_} ] } @{ $chaos };
```

.image-100[![](img/05.jpg)]

???

So I came up with this, pairing code snippets with the photos

This is a piece of production code I wrote, we use this in one of our tools

It transforms an array of hashes into an array of arrays where each array
contains the values from the hash sorted by the original hash keys or
the passed order of columns (hash slicing)

It fits with the image - we have chaos at the bottom, order at the top

```perl6
#!/usr/bin/env perl6

my @court = (
        [ 'FIN' ],
        [ 9 ,10 ],
        [   8   ],
        [ 6 , 7 ],
        [   5   ],
        [   4   ],
        [ 2 , 3 ],
        [   1   ],
);

my $skip = @court.[1..*].pick.pick;
my @play;

for @court.reverse -> $hop {
        @play.push( $hop.map( *.subst( /^$skip$/,'ðŸš«' ).list ) );
}

say @play.reverse.join( "\n" );
```

???

What about this one? I wrote this yesterday.

---
class: middle, theBlackBackground

```perl6
#!/usr/bin/env perl6

my @court = ( [ 'FIN' ],[ 9,10 ],[ 8 ],[ 6,7 ],[ 5 ],[ 4 ],[ 2,3 ],[ 1 ] );
my $skip  = @court.[1..*].pick.pick;
my @play;

for @court.reverse -> $hop {
        @play.push( $hop.map( *.subst( /^$skip$/,'ðŸš«' ).list ) );
}

say @play.reverse.join( "\n" );
```

It's hopscotch!

This may not be entirely idiomatic perl6, so let me know if so

---
class: center, middle, theBlackBackground

.image-100[![](img/07.jpg)]

???

I guess it would be nice to address this question

---
class: center, middle, theBlackBackground

# Acme::Glue

### https://metacpan.org/pod/Acme::Glue

???

So I've uploaded this module to CPAN.

I would like it very much if you could contribute a small snippet of code

The code does not have to be perl5 or perl6, it just has to be something
you're quite fond of for whatever reason

You can create a pull request and I'll add it to the module and it may end
up in the final photo project

---
class: center, middle, theBlackBackground

.image-100[![](img/08.jpg)]

???

You don't need to worry about it pairing with any particular code as a lot
of this is serendipitous - photos end up pairing with lots of other photos
when you have enough of them

If I get enough snippets of code then it will end up that lots of them will
pair with lots of other photos

And the code snippets will influence the final edit

This DeLorean runs on Perl!

.image-100[![](img/09.jpg)]

How do you solve the packing problem for camel shaped objects?

As I said, there's a couple more years left of shooting in the project and
possibly more, but I should start thinking about this now

---
class: center, middle, theBlackBackground

.image-100[![](img/10.jpg)]

???

I'm not aware of any other photo project like this, so it would be unique.

And I think it would be quite cool
